- Added some crude async support for loading data
- Improved UX
- Added more icons and the ability to change the icon set
- Added more granular color control
- Added real theme randomization and reset
- Moved from Create React App to Vite
- Removed Unsplash features and reduced dependency on third party resources
- Simplified themes and structure
- Left only the editor page
- Performance and bundle size optimizations
